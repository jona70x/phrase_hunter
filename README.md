Welcome to my fourth techdegree project!

This project mimics the popular game 'Phrase Hunter' where users have to guess the hidden phrase without losing all five lives.

I've added custom animations to the title, selecting buttons, and when letters when revealed.

This project uses just vanilla javaScript.
